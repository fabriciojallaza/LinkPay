## Overview

**PayrollManager_CCIP** is a smart contract that enables automated payroll payments both within the same network (Base) and across different blockchains using **Chainlink Automation** and **Chainlink CCIP**.

With this system, companies can register employees, assign salaries, and automate payments on a recurring schedule. If the employee’s salary is meant to be sent to another blockchain, the system automatically executes a **cross-chain transfer** using **CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol)**.

**¡IMPORTANT!**

For the tests we conducted with the CCIP-BnM token, you can route it through Chainlink and bridge it across different testnet chains. To access the test data, use the following link and make sure to fund your wallet with the test tokens provided:

https://docs.chain.link/ccip/test-tokens#evm-chains

**Note:** On mainnet, the CCIP-BnM test token would be replaced with USDC for actual payments.

## Technologies Used

* **Solidity** – Smart contract language
* **Chainlink Automation** – To schedule and execute automatic payments
* **Chainlink CCIP** – For secure cross-chain transfers
* **USDC (ERC20)** – Stablecoin used for salary payments
* **Base (Sepolia)** – Main deployment network
* **Arbitrum / Avalanche / Ethereum** – Destination networks for cross-chain payments

---

## Features

### Employer Management

* Register companies with their wallet and metadata.
* Update or deactivate companies (only the contract owner).

### Employee Management

* Register employees under a company.
* Assign wallet addresses, salaries, and destination blockchains.
* Update or deactivate employees.

### Automated & Cross-Chain Payments

* If `destinationChainSelector == 0`, the payment is made **locally on Base**.
* If the value is `1`, `2`, or `3`, a **cross-chain transfer** via **CCIP** is executed to:

  * `1`: Arbitrum
  * `2`: Avalanche
  * `3`: Ethereum
* Every payment is recorded through events for transparency and auditability.

## System Flow

1. **Company registration:**
   The contract owner registers a company and its employees, setting salary amounts and destination networks.

2. **Chainlink Automation:**
   The contract integrates with **Chainlink Automation**, which periodically checks if any scheduled payments are due.
   When a payment is due, it calls the `_scheduleOrExecutePayment()` function.

3. **Base Network Payment (Local):**
   If `destinationChainSelector == 0`, the contract directly transfers USDC from the company to the employee wallet on Base.

4. **Cross-Chain Payment (CCIP):**
   If the destination is another blockchain (`1`, `2`, or `3`), the contract:

   * Transfers the salary amount from the company to itself.
   * Calls `transferTokensPayLINK()` to send funds through **Chainlink CCIP**.
   * The CCIP message is received on the destination chain, and the employee receives the salary in USDC.

* Web3 companies with multi-chain teams
* DAO payrolls with distributed contributors
* Automated financial applications requiring cross-chain settlements
